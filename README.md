# Classification_regression
# Problem Statement
In today’s world of automation, the skills and knowledge of a person could be utilized at the best places possible by automating tasks wherever possible.
 As a part of the hospital automation system, one can build a system that would predict and estimate whether the patient should be categorized as an incare patient or an outcare patient 
with the help of several data points about the patients, their conditions and lab tests.

# Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict if the patient should be classified as in care or out care based on the patient's laboratory test result.

# About Dataset
## Context
In hospitals, medical treatments and surgeries can be categorized into inpatient and outpatient procedures. 
For patients, it is important to understand the difference between these two types of care, 
because they impact the length of a patient’s stay in a medical facility and the cost of a procedure.

Inpatient Care (Incare Patient) and Outpatient Care (Outcare Patient)

The difference between an inpatient and outpatient care is how long a patient must remain in the facility where they have the procedure done.

Inpatient care requires overnight hospitalization. 
Patients must stay at the medical facility where their procedure was done (which is usually a hospital) for at least one night. 
During this time, they remain under the supervision of a nurse or doctor.

Patients receiving outpatient care do not need to spend a night in a hospital. 
They are free to leave the hospital once the procedure is over. 
In some exceptional cases, they need to wait while anesthesia wears off or to make sure there are not any complications. 
As long as there are not any serious complications, patients do not have to spend the night being supervised.
